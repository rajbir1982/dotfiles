These are my dotfiles. They are mine and you can expect them to change, as my preferences change. Feel free to fork them and use them as a basis for yours.

NOTE: These dotfiles are slanted toward Linux and specifically ArchLinux.

== Installing

I manage my dotfiles with https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/[gnu stow], a symlink farm manager. To install on Arch Linux with `paru`:

....
paru stow
....

If that doesn't work, you can try the following:

....
sudo apt install stow
sudo dnf install stow
sudo pacman install stow
sudo yum install stow
brew install stow
....

Once stow is installed, just cd into this repository and create symlinks using stow:

....
chmod 700 setup.sh
./setup.sh
....
